Name:
Unflatten a List

Description:
You get an array of integers and have to unflatten it by these rules:

- You start at the first number.
- If this number x is smaller than 3, take this number x direct 
  for the new array and continue with the next number.
- If this number x is greater than 2, take the next x numbers (inclusive this number) as a 
  sub-array in the new array. Continue with the next number AFTER this taken numbers.
- If there are too few numbers to take by number, take the last available numbers.

[1,4,5,2,1,2,4,5,2,6,2,3,3] -> [1,[4,5,2,1],2,[4,5,2,6],2,[3,3]]
