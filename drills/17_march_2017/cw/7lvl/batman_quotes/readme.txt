Name:
Batman Quotes

Description:
Implement the getQuote method which takes in an array of quotes, and a string comprised 
of letters and a single number (e.g. "Rob1n") where the number corresponds to their 
quote indexed in the passed in array. Return the quote along with the character who 
said it.

Hint: You are guaranteed that the number in the passed in string is placed somewhere 
after the first character of the string. The quotes either belong to "Batman", "Robin", 
or "Joker".
