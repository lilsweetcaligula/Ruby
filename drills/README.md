If you wan' a ruby, you gotta drill!

Most of the problems presented here (unless otherwise noted) have been taken from various online judges. I don't take credit for the problems, - only for the solutions. A link to each problem's respective source and its author is included with every solution in the readme.txt file. Please let me know if a problem is missing any of those. Thanks! :)
